<h1>Act Now: A Warning in Image and Word</h1>
<p><img alt="Act Now - Protest Poster" src="docs/act_now.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This isn’t politics. It’s survival.</strong><br />
Trump’s authoritarian blueprint is no longer a warning—it’s in motion.<br />
Our courts, our votes, our voices—they are all under siege.<br />
Flood congressional phone lines. Protest quietly but forcefully.<br />
Expose the enablers. Amplify the truth. Disrupt the machine.<br />
History will ask what we did. Let your answer be: <strong>everything we could.</strong></p>
