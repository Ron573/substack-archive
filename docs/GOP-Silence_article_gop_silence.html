<h1>The Silence of the GOP Is Complicity: A Warning to MAGA</h1>
<p><em>Ronald J. Botelho — June 2025</em></p>
<p>The silence of the GOP is deafening—and damning. You are no longer a political party; you are subordinates to a great and growing evil that presses against us all.</p>
<p>To the MAGA faithful: you are not patriots. You are pawns. If you believe you are somehow immune to the chaotic whims of a man who respects no law, no truth, and no soul, then you are worse than misguided—you are deluded.</p>
<p>Do you understand that millions of children are dying <em>today</em>, worldwide, as a result of the destabilization, climate denial, and authoritarian policies advanced by Donald Trump, Project 2025, and the global oligarch network you’ve chosen to serve?</p>
<p>Yes, I’m talking to you, MAGA.<br />
Yes, I’m talking to you, cowed and complicit GOP.</p>
<p>You’ve aligned yourselves with a 34-times convicted felon—a man accused of sexual abuse, whose worldview is fueled by racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and raw authoritarian lust. He is senile, dangerous, and staggeringly unfit for office.</p>
<p>Do you even realize what you’ve done?</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve voted to dismantle Medicare and rob millions of Americans of healthcare.  </li>
<li>You’ve empowered a regime that serves billionaires and silences dissent.  </li>
<li>You’ve traded democracy for delusion, and justice for personal cowardice.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Are you so callous, so spineless, that you would watch this country unravel and still pretend you're in the right?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Frederick Douglass was talking about the need for slavery’s abolition, but his words are important for us now:<br />
<em>“The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglass warned us then—and his words burn with relevance now.</p>
<p>The silence of our institutions must be shattered.<br />
The complicity of our lawmakers must be unmasked.<br />
The erosion of our democracy must be resisted with every fiber of our being.<br />
The cult of personality surrounding a felonious tyrant must be broken by truth, not fear.<br />
And the people—<em>we the people</em>—must decide if this republic still breathes, or if we’ve already sold its soul to comfort and cowardice.</p>
<p>Because Douglass did not fight to watch freedom rot from the inside.<br />
And we do not inherit liberty—we defend it, or we lose it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Think.<br />
Rethink.<br />
Speak out—<strong>or be remembered as the fools who helped kill a republic</strong>.</p>
