<h1>Afghanistan: The Betrayal Continues</h1>

<h2>📍 Introduction: A Silenced Voice Returns</h2>
<p><img src="linkedin_censorship.png" alt="Silencing of Afghan Truth-Telling on LinkedIn" width="600" /></p>
<p><em>My voice was removed from LinkedIn for speaking openly about U.S. policy failures in Afghanistan. This graphic represents that act of erasure.</em></p>
<p>I once used LinkedIn to tell the truth about Afghanistan. But for my efforts to speak openly about American complicity and strategic failures, I was banned. Censored. Ultimately erased from a platform that claimed to support open discourse.</p>
<p>This article marks the resumption of daily reporting on Afghanistan—on my own terms. The story unfolding now is one of <strong>systemic betrayal</strong>, and this time, it's not the Taliban doing the betraying. It’s us.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🌍 A Geopolitical System in Flux</h2>
<p>As analyzed in my earlier piece <a href="https://github.com/Ron573/afghanistan-system-map">“Power by Proxy”</a>, three powers—India, China, and Pakistan—are aggressively vying for influence in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Their motivations differ—economic, security, and strategic—but they all converge on one point: <strong>Afghanistan now holds systemic leverage</strong>.</p>

<h2>🇺🇸 The Trump Administration’s Abandonment of Afghan Allies</h2>
<p>While regional players maneuver for advantage, the United States is <strong>forfeiting moral ground</strong>. Under the Trump administration’s renewed immigration restrictions and discretionary enforcement, Afghan allies—interpreters, contractors, and informants—have found themselves stranded in legal limbo, facing <strong>deportation, death threats, or outright betrayal</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>❌ Termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS)</h3>
<p>In early 2025, the Trump administration terminated TPS for approximately 9,000 Afghan nationals. The administration justified its decision by asserting that Afghanistan had become "more stable"—a claim contradicted by the Taliban’s continued persecution of former U.S. partners (Lawrence &amp; Bowman, 2025).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s a death penalty for them if they return,” warned Zia Ghafoori, a former U.S. Special Forces interpreter (Lawrence &amp; Bowman, 2025).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>🛑 Suspension of Refugee Admissions</h3>
<p>The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) was suspended under a 2025 executive order. Thousands of vetted Afghan allies found themselves stranded, with no pathway forward (Hadid &amp; Kim, 2025).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fulfilling that promise is not just about policy—it’s about honor,” said Shawn VanDiver, founder of #AfghanEvac (Hadid &amp; Kim, 2025).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>🧾 Collapse of the SIV Pipeline</h3>
<p>Though the SIV program remains legally intact, the Trump administration’s operational slowdown left thousands of former U.S. allies exposed (Hadid &amp; Kim, 2025).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He is unfortunately putting our lives in grave danger,” said Roshangar, a former Afghan defense liaison (Hadid &amp; Kim, 2025).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>💔 Betrayal in the Eyes of U.S. Veterans</h3>
<p>Veterans’ groups were among the most vocal critics of the betrayal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Deporting Afghans who bravely helped us would be Trump’s catastrophe,” warned Bradley Bowman (Lawrence &amp; Bowman, 2025).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🔁 Systemic Feedback Breakdown</h2>
<p>From a systems science perspective, these actions generate cascading effects:
- <strong>Loss of trust → Reduced operational intelligence</strong>
- <strong>Abandonment → Future ally recruitment collapses</strong>
- <strong>Policy erosion → U.S. credibility disintegrates</strong></p>

<hr />
<h2>📣 A Call to Action</h2>
<p>This is a moral systems failure. The betrayal of our allies endangers future missions, undermines democratic legitimacy, and feeds the very instability we claim to oppose.</p>
