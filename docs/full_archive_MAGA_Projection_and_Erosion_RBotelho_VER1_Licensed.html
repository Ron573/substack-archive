<h1>Enough. This Is Propaganda by Projection.</h1>
<p>The MAGA cult’s manufactured outrage over James Comey's innocuous “8647” post is not just hypocrisy—it is psychological warfare. These are the same people who hawked “86 46” t-shirts with zero irony, yet now scream “assassination” when the same symbolic language is turned back on their messiah. The audacity to demand Comey’s arrest—when their own leader incited an insurrection, trafficked pardons, and openly threatened judges—proves one thing: they want to criminalize dissent.</p>
<p>Every Republican enabling this fascistic tantrum deserves to be expelled from office—not because they disagree with Democrats, but because they’ve abandoned their oath to the Constitution in service of a delusional autocrat. And the six Supreme Court justices who granted Trump a shield of absolute immunity? They have not defended the law—they have defiled it. If this country still believes in accountability, they too must be investigated for aiding sedition.</p>
<p>This is not conservatism. It is a personality cult built on weaponized victimhood, deliberate misinformation, and projection. MAGA cries foul not because they’re offended—they cry foul because they want the exclusive right to threaten, lie, and manipulate with impunity. No more. We will not let traitors masquerade as patriots.</p>

<h2>The American Threshold</h2>
<p>I’ve seen where this is headed. You don’t need a leaked memo—you just need to open your eyes. Federal agencies are already crossing lines: no warrants, no probable cause—just uniforms, guns, and intimidation. I’ve heard firsthand what it’s like to be approached in your own country, treated like a suspect because of where you’re sitting or what you look like. This isn’t hypothetical. It’s real. And it’s accelerating.</p>
<p>Now look at what they’re doing behind the scenes. The FBI’s counterintelligence unit? Dismantled. The OCDETF, which goes after narco-money and laundering? Being erased by Pam Bondi. Tulsi Gabbard is clearing out senior intelligence officials like it’s a sweep operation. Why? Because oversight gets in the way of corruption. Trump doesn’t want a government—he wants a crew. And you don’t need watchdogs when you’re laundering power.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: Everything Trumpski touches is soaked in foreign influence. Russian oligarchs and mob cash paved his road to power. Now, with Saudi Arabia, the paper trail disappears, replaced by handshakes and oil deals. These meetings aren’t about diplomacy—they’re about selling off American interests to shield his empire and keep the grift going. Don’t let the flags fool you. This man and his loyalists have never served this country—they’ve only sold it.</p>
