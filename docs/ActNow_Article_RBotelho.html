<blockquote>
<p><strong>This isn’t politics. It’s survival.</strong><br />
Trump’s authoritarian blueprint is no longer a warning—it’s in motion.<br />
Our courts, our votes, our voices—they are all under siege.<br />
Flood congressional phone lines. Protest quietly but forcefully.<br />
Expose the enablers. Amplify the truth. Disrupt the machine.<br />
History will ask what we did. Let your answer be: <strong>everything we could.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is your call to action. Not tomorrow. <strong>Now.</strong></p>
<p>The image above symbolizes more than resistance—it represents our last line of defense: collective awareness and strategic disobedience. The Liberty Bell is cracked. The scales of justice hang broken. Yet we stand.</p>
