> **This isn’t politics. It’s survival.**\
> Trump’s authoritarian blueprint is no longer a warning—it’s in motion.\
> Our courts, our votes, our voices—they are all under siege.\
> Flood congressional phone lines.
> Protest quietly but forcefully.\
> Expose the enablers.
> Amplify the truth.
> Disrupt the machine.\
> History will ask what we did.
> Let your answer be: **everything we could.**
