# The Silence of the GOP Is Complicity: A Warning to MAGA  
*Ronald J. Botelho — June 2025*

The silence of the GOP is deafening—and damning. You are no longer a political party; you are subordinates to a great and growing evil that presses against us all.

To the MAGA faithful: you are not patriots. You are pawns. If you believe you are somehow immune to the chaotic whims of a man who respects no law, no truth, and no soul, then you are worse than misguided—you are deluded.

Do you understand that millions of children are dying *today*, worldwide, as a result of the destabilization, climate denial, and authoritarian policies advanced by Donald Trump, Project 2025, and the global oligarch network you’ve chosen to serve?

Yes, I’m talking to you, MAGA.  
Yes, I’m talking to you, cowed and complicit GOP.

You’ve aligned yourselves with a 34-times convicted felon—a man accused of sexual abuse, whose worldview is fueled by racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and raw authoritarian lust. He is senile, dangerous, and staggeringly unfit for office.

Do you even realize what you’ve done?

- You’ve voted to dismantle Medicare and rob millions of Americans of healthcare.  
- You’ve empowered a regime that serves billionaires and silences dissent.  
- You’ve traded democracy for delusion, and justice for personal cowardice.  

Are you so callous, so spineless, that you would watch this country unravel and still pretend you're in the right?

> Frederick Douglass was talking about the need for slavery’s abolition, but his words are important for us now:  
> *“The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.”*

Douglass warned us then—and his words burn with relevance now.

The silence of our institutions must be shattered.  
The complicity of our lawmakers must be unmasked.  
The erosion of our democracy must be resisted with every fiber of our being.  
The cult of personality surrounding a felonious tyrant must be broken by truth, not fear.  
And the people—*we the people*—must decide if this republic still breathes, or if we’ve already sold its soul to comfort and cowardice.

Because Douglass did not fight to watch freedom rot from the inside.  
And we do not inherit liberty—we defend it, or we lose it.

Think.  
Rethink.  
Speak out—**or be remembered as the fools who helped kill a republic**.
