> **This isn’t politics. It’s survival.**  
> Trump’s authoritarian blueprint is no longer a warning—it’s in motion.  
> Our courts, our votes, our voices—they are all under siege.  
> Flood congressional phone lines. Protest quietly but forcefully.  
> Expose the enablers. Amplify the truth. Disrupt the machine.  
> History will ask what we did. Let your answer be: **everything we could.**

## Call to Action

This is your call to act—not tomorrow, not eventually, but **right now**.

- Share the poster far and wide
- Use it in your presentations, blogs, or campaigns
- Embed the message into every platform you influence
- Never stop telling the truth

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Placeholder for future visuals or plots
# For example: barplot(c(5, 8, 13), col = "darkred", names.arg = c("Silence", "Action", "Hope"))
```
